### log entry: i've been shipping quietly...

**BUILDathon retro:**

- read parts [1](https://www.pcbo.xyz/blog/log12), [2](https://www.pcbo.xyz/blog/log13) and [3](https://www.pcbo.xyz/blog/log14)
- on part 3, i mostly stepped aside and watched as Leal was cruising a working version to submit for BUILDathon, having him teach me each step of the day wouldn't be productive
- now, waiting for final results

**New repo's BUILD + Passport:**

- Have made some contributions recently to BUILD and the Passport app
- Getting more and more comfortable with coding
- All core team members will become code-ready, we're a team a builders so everyone should ship software.

**next steps:**

- Keep building and shipping
