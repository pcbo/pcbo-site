### Log Entry 3: Contributing to Talent Protocol

**What:**

1. CTO Leal added me as contributor to Talent Protocol org
2. Updated README with our mission statement
3. Archived few old unused repos

**README Update:**

- Added new section with our mission
- "We are on a mission to help the next generation of builders succeed by making professional reputation data easily accessible and human potential more visible"

**Housekeeping:**

- Explored org repos and identified inactive ones
- Archived repos for old products/projects

**Feelings:**

- Exciting to directly contribute to Talent Protocol even if it's just a README update
- Still, adding our core mission felt good
- Housekeeping is always good too

**Next:**

- Add my PFP to pcbo.xyz
