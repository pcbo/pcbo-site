### log entry 3: contributing to talent protocol

**what:**
1. cto Leal added me as contributor to talent protocol org
2. updated readme with our mission statement
3. archived few old unused repos

**readme update:**
- added new section with our mission
- "we are on a mission to help the next generation of builders succeed by making professional reputation data easily accessible and human potential more visible"

**housekeeping:**
- explored org repos and identified inactive ones
- archived repos for old products/projects

**feelings:**
- exciting to directly contribute to talent protocol even if it's just a README update
- still, adding our core mission felt good
- housekeeping is always good too
