### log entry 6: Summer Builders NFT collection on Zora

**what:**
- [launched an NFT collection on Zora with Simon](https://zora.co/collect/base:0xb0fa7a2ed2e734b986160399ea883004610c9ae6)
- 100 unique Summer Builder characters, 10 were shipped first
- characters designed with AI (Midjourney), inspired by 80s/90s TV shows
- incorporated personal traits of OGs from BUILD + Talent Protocol
- added Summer vibes and aesthetic to the designs
- main reason for doing this collection: celebrating fellow builders, having fun and learn a lot ofc

**process:**
- brainstormed concept and creative direction
- used AI image generation tools for initial character designs
- manually edited and added Summer and BUILD elements
- set up Zora collection and minted NFTs
- promoted and shared the Summer Builders collection

**gratitude:**
- pleasure working (mostly async) with Simon
- we always come up with cool, creative ideas together!

**learnings:**
- main issue was distribution and getting visibility
 - our launch coincided with peak Onchain Summer activity...
 - very noisy, hard to cut through with promotion
 - neither of us have high social capital scores on Farcaster, yet!
- 100 NFT supply per character was overambitious for a new collection
 - should have kept it to 10 mints max per Summer Builder NFT

**takeaways:**
- distribution is key, especially in crowded markets
- social capital and community building matters
- start smaller for new NFT projects, selling out is important â€“ scale comes later

**next:**
- we're revealing all characters in the next few days on Farcaster
- keep promoting the collection on different channels
- try the Farcaster frame feature on Zora and also creating a Bounty through Bountycaster
