### Log Entry 6: Summer Builders NFT Collection on Zora

**What:**

- [Launched an NFT collection on Zora with Simon](https://zora.co/collect/base:0xb0fa7a2ed2e734b986160399ea883004610c9ae6)
- 100 unique Summer Builder characters, 10 were shipped first
- Characters designed with AI (Midjourney), inspired by 80s/90s TV shows
- Incorporated personal traits of OGs from BUILD + Talent Protocol
- Added Summer vibes and aesthetic to the designs
- Main reason for doing this collection: celebrating fellow builders, having fun and learn a lot ofc

**Process:**

- Brainstormed concept and creative direction
- Used AI image generation tools for initial character designs
- Manually edited and added Summer and BUILD elements
- Set up Zora collection and minted NFTs
- Promoted and shared the Summer Builders collection

**Gratitude:**

- Pleasure working (mostly async) with Simon
- We always come up with cool, creative ideas together!

**Learnings:**

- Main issue was distribution and getting visibility
- Our launch coincided with peak Onchain Summer activity...
- Very noisy, hard to cut through with promotion
- Neither of us have high social capital scores on Farcaster, yet!
- 100 NFT supply per character was overambitious for a new collection
- Should have kept it to 10 mints max per Summer Builder NFT

**Takeaways:**

- Distribution is key, especially in crowded markets
- Social capital and community building matters
- Start smaller for new NFT projects, selling out is important â€“ scale comes later

**Next:**

- We're revealing all characters in the next few days on Farcaster
- Keep promoting the collection on different channels
- Try the Farcaster frame feature on Zora and also creating a Bounty through Bountycaster
