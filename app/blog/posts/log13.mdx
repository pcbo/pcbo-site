### Log Entry 13: BUILDathon Report – Day 2

**Report:**

- Met at Lisbon office at [Poolside](https://www.poolside.co/hub) with the Talent Protocol team, and some other cool folks joined
- We were wearing [BUILD](https://build.top) merch, so obvs we had some photos taken
- Watching Leal code is like watching a magic show. Learned so much... that it's super hard to type down into a single report!
- Macedo also gave an interesting insight: in a AI-packed future, questions trump answers

**Updated User Journey:**

1. Leal wakes up and weighs himself on his Withings scale
2. Leal goes to [oracles.fit](http://oracles.fit) and signs off his results onchain. Leal is already logged in with his wallet and has given read-access permissions to his Withings account
3. Leal casts into /fitness in order to be eligible for the "Get Fit" round on [rounds.wtf](http://rounds.wtf)
4. Automatic rewards distribution through Rounds.wtf using BUILD

**Detailed Planning:**

**_Saturday Progress:_**

- Create site

**_Sunday Plan:_**

- Fix Withings bugs

- Share on Farcaster [/fitness](https://warpcast.com/~/channel/fitness) channel
