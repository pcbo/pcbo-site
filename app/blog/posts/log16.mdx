### Log Entry 16: Disappeared for a While...

**Post-BUILDathon 2024 Reality:**

- After the July 2024 entry, we entered TGE prep aka full token launch mode
- All-in on legal, tokenomics, liquidity, and ops
- Writing fell off the radar, energy went into shipping and surviving Token Launch season

**Still Kept Building:**

- Built a personal goals tracker with Lovable, super lightweight and use it every day to track health habits
- Created my Chief of Staff AI on ChatGPT, my CEO productivity has 10x'd

**Next Steps:**

- Relaunch the tracker with better UX
- Explore new build ideas, a few are brewing...
- Use this space more consistently to document and stay accountable
