### log entry: disappeared for a while...

**post-BUILDathon 2024 reality:**

- after the July 2024 entry, we entered TGE prep — full token launch mode
- all-in on legal, tokenomics, liquidity, and ops — the usual suspects
- writing fell off the radar, energy went into shipping and surviving Tokamon season

**still kept building:**

- built a personal goals tracker with Lovable — lightweight and actually useful for tracking habits and health
- planning a rebuild using a faster, cleaner vibe coding approach
- created my Chief of Staff AI on ChatGPT — async, context-aware, and already saving hours weekly

**next steps:**

- relaunch the tracker with better UX and flexibility
- explore new build ideas — a few are brewing
- use this space more consistently to document and stay accountable
