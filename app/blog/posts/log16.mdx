### log entry: disappeared for a while...

**post-BUILDathon 2024 reality:**

- after the July 2024 entry, we entered TGE prep aka full token launch mode
- all-in on legal, tokenomics, liquidity, and ops
- writing fell off the radar, energy went into shipping and surviving Token Launch season

**still kept building:**

- built a personal goals tracker with Lovable, super lightweight and use it every day to track health habits
- created my Chief of Staff AI on ChatGPT, my CEO productive has 10x'd

**next steps:**

- relaunch the tracker with better UX
- explore new build ideas, a few are brewing...
- use this space more consistently to document and stay accountable
