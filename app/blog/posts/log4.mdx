### log entry 4: adding image assets

**what:**
1. added profile picture (pfp) image to pcbo.xyz
2. did some typos house-keeping on talentprotocol.com site repo
3. asked for help from our product designer, some images need to be adapted to mobile (?)

**github web ui:**
- typed '.' in repo which opened web editor
- made and committed changes directly in browser ui!
- using github now compared to 10y ago is such a good vibe :)

**next:**
- overcome issues with image updates on talentprotocol.com
- create a new structure on pcbo.xyz, for deeper thoughts, side by side with log entries
