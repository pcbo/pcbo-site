### Log Entry 4: Adding Image Assets

**What:**

1. Added profile picture (PFP) image to pcbo.xyz
2. Did some typos house-keeping on talentprotocol.com site repo
3. Asked for help from our product designer, some images may need to be adapted to mobile

**GitHub Web UI:**

- Typed '.' in repo which opened web editor
- Made and committed changes directly in browser UI!
- Using GitHub now compared to 10y ago is such a good vibe :)

**Next:**

- Overcome issues with image updates on talentprotocol.com
- Create a new structure on pcbo.xyz, for deeper thoughts, side by side with log entries
