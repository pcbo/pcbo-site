### Log Entry 8: Summer Builders NFT Post-Mortem

**Distribution Challenges:**

- Our launch date coincided with peak Onchain Summer activity
- Neither me nor Simon have high Social Capital on Farcaster, yet...

**Supply Strategy:**

- High NFT supply (1000 mints, we had less than 100...) was overambitious

**Community Engagement:**

- Some OGs loved the collection enough to actively share, some others just thought it was funny
- If we did more research work and better storytelling, they'd probably feel more engaged

**Aesthetics:**

- Could have played better with aesthetics and used colors more aligned with Base

**Influencers:**

- Involving some Farcaster celebrities would have helped "farm" more attention

**Next Steps:**

- Focus on building personal social capital on Farcaster
- Apply these learnings to future projects
