### log entry 8: Summer Builders NFT post-mortem

**distribution challenges:**
- our launch date coincided with peak Onchain Summer activity
- neither me nor Simon have high Social Capital on Farcaster, yet...

**supply strategy:**
- high NFT supply (1000 mints, we had less than 100...) was overambitious

**community engagement:**
- some OGs loved the collection enough to actively share, some others just thought it was funny
- if we did more research work and better storytelling, they'd probably feel more engaged

**aesthetics:** 
- could have played better with aesthetics and used colors more aligned with Base

**influencers:**
- involving some Farcaster celebrities would have helped "farm" more attention

**next steps:**
- focus on building personal social capital on Farcaster
- apply these learnings to future projects
