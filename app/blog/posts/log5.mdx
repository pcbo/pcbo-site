### Log Entry 5: VSCode & Buildathon

**Progress Report:**

- Did my first code change and commit using VSCode + GitHub Desktop
- Registered for Onchain Summer Buildathon on Devfolio, add to stake some ETH to show my builder commitment
- Also minted a [SupaBald Jess](https://opensea.io/assets/base/0xb27b1369808c817d61baca58833232f97add28ea/70)
- Started working on a PWA health app project for the Buildathon (which will substitute the one I use nowadays...)
- Created and shared first app functionality draft document and shared with my accountability buddies (Nuno and Leal)

**Gratitude To:**

- Filipe for helping edit Figma design file
- Leal for helping with deployment issue troubleshooting

**Blockers:**

- Still waiting on product designer feedback on some assets issue

**Learnings:**

- Coding today vs 10-years ago is just wow!
- Always send a loom to designers (instead of writing) to facilitate comms

**Next:**

- Start using branches and pull requests instead of committing to main (for Talent Protocol repo)
- Iterate on PWA app based on feedback from Nuno and Leal
- Define next steps for Buildathon project
