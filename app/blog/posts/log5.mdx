### log entry 5: VScode & Buildathon

**progress report:**
- did my first code change and commit using VSCode + GitHub Desktop
- registered for Onchain Summer Buildathon on Devfolio, add to stake some ETH to show my builder commitment
- also minted a [SupaBald Jess](https://opensea.io/assets/base/0xb27b1369808c817d61baca58833232f97add28ea/70)
- started working on a PWA health app project for the Buildathon (which will substitute the one I use nowadays...)
- created and shared first app functionality draft document and shared with my accountability buddies (Nuno and Leal)

**gratitude to:**
- Filipe for helping edit Figma design file
- Leal for helping with deployment issue troubleshooting

**blockers:** 
- still waiting on product designer feedback on some assets issue

**learnings:**
- coding today vs 10-years ago is just wow!
- always send a loom to designers (instead of writing) to facilitate comms

**next:**
- start using branches and pull requests instead of committing to main (for Talent Protocol repo)
- iterate on PWA app based on feedback from Nuno and Leal
- define next steps for Buildathon project
