### log entry 7: Cloudflare caching and git file rename issues

**Cloudflare cache busting:**
- Cloudflare caches css files, causing outdated styles to persist
- to bust the cache, Leal appended a version query param to the css file url
  - e.g., `href="css/talent-protocol-v2.webflow.css?v=1"`
- the value after the url can be any string, it acts as a cache buster

**git file renaming:**
- wanted to rename `Coinbase_logo.svg` to `coinbase_logo.svg` for consistency reasons
- git doesn't automatically track renames with different casing
- Leal used the `git mv` command to force the rename:
  - `git mv images/Coinbase_logo.svg images/coinbase_logo.svg`

**gratitude:**
- learned these techniques thanks to Leal's guidance. Dr. Peter Venkman would be proud: https://warpcast.com/pcbo/0x66f25aa3

**learnings:**
- Cloudflare caching can cause outdated css to persist, be mindful for future css updates
- cache busting with versioned query params is a simple solution
- git doesn't automatically track renames with casing changes, use consistent casing for file names from the start
