### Log Entry 7: Cloudflare Caching and Git File Rename Issues

**Cloudflare Cache Busting:**

- Cloudflare caches CSS files, causing outdated styles to persist
- To bust the cache, Leal appended a version query param to the CSS file URL
  - e.g., `href="css/talent-protocol-v2.webflow.css?v=1"`
- The value after the URL can be any string, it acts as a cache buster

**Git File Renaming:**

- Wanted to rename `Coinbase_logo.svg` to `coinbase_logo.svg` for consistency reasons
- Git doesn't automatically track renames with different casing
- Leal used the `git mv` command to force the rename:
  - `git mv images/Coinbase_logo.svg images/coinbase_logo.svg`

**Gratitude:**

- Learned these techniques thanks to Leal's guidance. [Dr. Peter Venkman would be proud](https://warpcast.com/pcbo/0x66f25aa3)

**Learnings:**

- Cloudflare caching can cause outdated CSS to persist, be mindful for future CSS updates
- Cache busting with versioned query params is a simple solution
- Git doesn't automatically track renames with casing changes, use consistent casing for file names from the start
