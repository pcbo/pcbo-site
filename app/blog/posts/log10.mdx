### log entry: supporting other builders

**what:**
- provided product feedback to 3 recent projects that i've used.

**[Icebreaker](icebreaker.xyz/)**
- i use this app for people I meet IRL to scan my phone wallpaper in order to stay in touch.
- [Dan](https://warpcast.com/web3pm) and [Jack](https://warpcast.com/j4ck.eth) invited me to a super candid conversation about recruitment, networking and Icebreaker competition too.
- i'm bullish about Icebreaker and heard an integration with [Talent Passport](https://passport.talentprotocol.com) is coming.

**[Bountycaster](bountycaster.xyz)**
- used Bountycaster bot on Farcaster to find someone to create a video for [Summer Builders NFT collection](https://zora.co/collect/base:0xb0fa7a2ed2e734b986160399ea883004610c9ae6).
- paid 4M $BUILD to the best execution!
- reached out to [Linda](https://warpcast.com/linda) with some feedback, got an instant reply.
- ended up 'scouting' a recent cool release: [Bountycaster onchain attestations](https://www.launchcaster.xyz/bountycaster/6673cd2aa0fc18971f72e414).

**[Beearly](beearly.club)**
- used Beearly to create a waitlist frame for [Summer of $TALENT](https://summer.talentprotocol.com).
- i already knew [Limone](https://warpcast.com/limone.eth) and the [Builders Garden team](https://www.builders.garden).
- shared some feedback so they can improve the product, definitely recommend for someone launching some new and cool on Farcaster.
