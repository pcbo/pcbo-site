### Log Entry 10: Supporting Other Builders

**What:**

- Provided product feedback to 3 recent projects that I've used.

**[Icebreaker](icebreaker.xyz/)**

- I use this app for people I meet IRL to scan my phone wallpaper in order to stay in touch.
- [Dan](https://warpcast.com/web3pm) and [Jack](https://warpcast.com/j4ck.eth) invited me to a super candid conversation about recruitment, networking and Icebreaker competition too.
- I'm bullish about Icebreaker and heard an integration with [Talent Passport](https://passport.talentprotocol.com) is coming.

**[Bountycaster](bountycaster.xyz)**

- Used Bountycaster bot on Farcaster to find someone to create a video for [Summer Builders NFT collection](https://zora.co/collect/base:0xb0fa7a2ed2e734b986160399ea883004610c9ae6).
- Paid 4M $BUILD to the best execution!
- Reached out to [Linda](https://warpcast.com/linda) with some feedback, got an instant reply.
- Ended up 'scouting' a recent cool release: [Bountycaster onchain attestations](https://www.launchcaster.xyz/bountycaster/6673cd2aa0fc18971f72e414).

**[Beearly](beearly.club)**

- Used Beearly to create a waitlist frame for [Summer of $TALENT](https://summer.talentprotocol.com).
- I already knew [Limone](https://warpcast.com/limone.eth) and the [Builders Garden team](https://www.builders.garden).
- Shared some feedback so they can improve the product, definitely recommend for someone launching some new and cool on Farcaster.
