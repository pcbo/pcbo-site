### Log Entry 12: BUILDathon Report – Day 1

**Report:**

- Simplified user journey
- We're cooking something cool related to $GETFIT token, can't share yet
- Purchased [Claude](https://claude.ai) premium and [Midjourney](https://midjourney.com) subs

**Simplified User Journey:**

1. Leal wakes up and weighs himself on his Withings scale
2. Leal goes to [oracles.fit](http://oracles.fit) site and signs off his results onchain. Leal is already logged in with his Farcaster account and has given read-access permissions to his Withings account
3. Leal casts into /fitness in order to be eligible for the "Get Fit" round on [rounds.wtf](http://rounds.wtf)
4. Automatic rewards distribution through Rounds.wtf

- API Withings: [https://developer.withings.com/api-reference](https://developer.withings.com/api-reference/)
- EAS: [https://docs.attest.org/docs/quick--start/quickstart](https://docs.attest.org/docs/quick--start/quickstart)

**Detailed Planning:**
