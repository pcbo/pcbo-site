### log entry: BUILDathon Report – Day 1

**report:**
- simplified user journey (see below)
- some alpha can't be shared here but we're cooking something cool related to $GETFIT token
- purchased [Claude](https://claude.ai) premium and [midjourney](https://midjourney.com) subs
- bought a domain: [oracles.fit](http://oracles.fit)

** simplified user journey:**
1. Leal wakes up and weighs himself on his Withings scale 
2. Leal goes to [oracles.fit](http://oracles.fit) site and signs off his results onchain. Leal is already logged in with his Farcaster account and has given read-access permissions to his Withings account
3. Leal casts into /fitness in order to be eligible for the “Get Fit” round on [rounds.wtf](http://rounds.wtf)
4. Automatic rewards distribution through Rounds.wtf

**tech to use:**
- API Withings: [https://developer.withings.com/api-reference](https://developer.withings.com/api-reference/)
- EAS: [https://docs.attest.org/docs/quick--start/quickstart](https://docs.attest.org/docs/quick--start/quickstart)

**detailed planning:**

***Saturday:***
- create site with Vercel

***Sunday:***
- pick logo + cover image
- setup Rounds.wtf
- test everything and deliver on Devfolio
